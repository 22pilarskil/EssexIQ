        <p>As members of the Millburn Robotics Program (winners of the VEX Robotics 2018-2019 World Championship as well as recipients of numerous awards), we have accumulated a lot of experience in the fields of programming and engineering. We plan to share this knowledge with all attendees in an immersive, 3 week program that will go over engineering concepts as well as programming concepts. We will be working with parts from the VexIQ platform to apply these ideas into working robots in teams of 2-3. Towards the tail end of the program, they will be used in a competitive tournament to showcase all of the skills picked up during time at camp. While working towards this goal, we will also be providing basic supplementary education in other fields such as AI or website development - as a matter of fact, this website is coded from scratch by instructors that you will meet in the summer! At Essex IQ, we have a very diverse team that is experienced in all these subjects, and we are confident in our ability to provide an important and valuable educational opportunity that we hope will propel attendees to pursue careers in S.T.E.M., that includes but is not limited to:</p>
        <ul style="text-align:left;">
          <li>Using gear ratios to acheive mechanical advantage</li>
          <li>Understanding friction and how to minimize its impact on a system</li>
          <li>Fundamental mechanisms designed to minimize the work and make efficient an array of different tasks</li>
          <li>Block code instruction, and depending on degree of individual success with basic concepts, written code instruction</li>
          <li>Using programming structures such as loops and conditionals to optimize code</li>
        </ul>

          <li>Busing to and from Millburn High School will be available complimentary to all students attending the program. Pick up and drop off location will be located near Payne Tech and/or Sussex Ave (exact location T.B.D.). A member of our team as well as an adult mentor will be at the busing location to acompany students to and from Millburn each day</li>
          <li>A lunch of pizza along with snacks throughout the day will be provided. We will try our best to accomodate other needs as well</li>
