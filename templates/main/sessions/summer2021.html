        <p>For the Summer 2021 session, we will be working with the VEX IQ build system to create and program fully functional robots over the course of three weeks! Students will work in small groups of 2-3 with a dedicated instructor per group. The first two weeks of the program will be dedicated to instruction in engineering and programming concepts to help students create functional robots with different capabilities, such as object manipulation, path finding, and drive control. During this time, students will participate in mini-challenges for the chance to implement what they learn in a fun, competitive environment. 

        For the final week, students will participate in the VEX IQ game Highrise as a cumulative project. Students will have the opportunity to design and program their robot it to best complete the tasks required of the Highrise game. While we will provide assistance when necessary, this final week is designed to be a showcase for students to use what they have learned on their own.</p>
